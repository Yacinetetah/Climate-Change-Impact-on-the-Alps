# Alps Climate Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes climate change in the Alps using historical meteorological and hydrological data. The study focuses on temperature trends, precipitation variability, and river flow changes over the decades.

## Data Sources
- **Météo France:** Daily climate data from 1950 to 2023.
- **Hydrological Data:** River flow records for the Arve River under different climate scenarios (historical, RCP4.5, RCP8.5).
- **Scientific Reports (2020):** Study on the impact of climate change on Mont Blanc glaciers.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning:** Selecting relevant columns and handling missing values.
2. **Trend Analysis:** Detecting changes in temperature, precipitation, and river discharge over time.
3. **Regression Models:** Predicting future climate trends using linear regression and machine learning.
4. **Visualization:** Graphs showing temperature evolution, extreme weather events, and water resource variations.

## Key Findings
- **Temperature:** A steady increase of +0.0136°C per year, leading to a predicted +8.03°C by 2100.
- **Precipitation:** High interannual variability with seasonal shifts.
- **River Flow:**
  - **Winter discharge is increasing** due to glacier melt.
  - **Summer discharge is decreasing,** posing risks to water availability.

## Impact of Climate Change
- **Water Resources:** Potential droughts in summer and increased winter floods.
- **Hydropower & Agriculture:** Seasonal changes may reduce electricity production and crop yields.
- **Ecosystems:** Disruptions in aquatic and mountainous habitats.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Linear Regression, Random Forest
